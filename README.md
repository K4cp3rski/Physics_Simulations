This is a repository for the "Computer Modelling of Physical Phenomena" course given at the Faculty of Physics, University of Warsaw, in the summer term of 2022.
Jakub Tworzyd≈Ço and Daniel Matoz-Fernandez gave the course.

The following repository contains my solutions to labs, as well as archived slides.
